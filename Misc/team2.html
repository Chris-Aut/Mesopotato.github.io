<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4>Artificial intelligence's power has rapidly expanded, and it is now one of the most important ethical challenges. For certainty, Ai brings convenience to current human life, provides us with a better mankind of currently is. AI ethics problem must not be ignored especially in fields of privacy and economic inequality costed.
AI has already been considered as a threat to some jobs around the world. Ever since human life from industrial revolution, automation has been a key contributor to employment losses. AI will just broaden this trend to include other industries, including those that have traditionally been assumed to be immune to automation. Therefore, while Ai is taking over dominance of certain job, assisting in transition for those people is crucial as high unemployment rate will lead to an unstable society including riot. 
Artificial intelligence is just like another big leap for mankind. Like caveman discover fire, or human entering industrial revolution. As long as human can set up regulation and limitation for unethical act. Artificial intelligence will able to affect humankind for changes to better future.
