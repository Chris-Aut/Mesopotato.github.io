<h1>Technology Risks</h1>

<ul>
<p>Privacy in terms of it having a data base which registers your face, bank details, purchase times, visit logging etc which could be used for nefarious purposes</p>
<p>Human bias in terms of AI learning from humans at the more advanced levels and developing similar bad behaviors that current fast food restaurant workers have</p>
<p>Differing levels of service if there is some sort of system logging which favors frequently visiting customers, workers in the industry or the higher-ups</p>
<p>A huge increase in job losses as AI replaces human workers in fast food outlets such as McDonalds who have roughly 10,000 employees across New Zealand</p>
